  # It's necessary to check releases instead of tags here (to avoid upstream
  # tag issues) but we can't use the `GithubLatest` strategy because upstream
  # creates releases for more than one minor version (i.e., the "latest" release
  # isn't the newest version at times). We normally avoid checking the releases
  # page because pagination can cause problems but this is our only choice.
